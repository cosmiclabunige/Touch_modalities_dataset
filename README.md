# Touch_modalities_dataset
3-class touch modalities dataset: slide a finger, brush a paintbrush, and rolling a washer. The dataset is made of 840 tensor data, 280 per class. Seventy subjects performed each touch action two times on a 4 Ã— 4 piezoelectric sensors matrix in two directions, i.e. horizontal and vertical starting from a random position. Each touch lasted 10 seconds and signals have been sampled at 3kHz.
